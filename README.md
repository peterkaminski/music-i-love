# Music I Love, by Peter Kaminski

Hello, my name is Peter Kaminski, and this is a knowledgebase of **Music I Love**.

Click the "All Pages" link above to navigate into the knowledgebase. NOTE: all of the links from "All Pages" will work, but many links from any regular page will go to the "Sorry, Page Doesn't Exist Yet" page. This is because the knowledgebase is still under construction, but the site builder I'm using doesn't handle that well yet. It will get better when the site builder learns to flag links to pages that don't exist better.

I'm building this knowledgbase so I know what I know, and so that I can remember what I've learned about each song here.

My music taste runs to pop music, dance music (from multiple decades and centuries), _a cappella_ pop music, movie soundtracks, and some other forms.

Please let me know what you think of this resource, and especially, if I've gotten something wrong or missed something important.  Send me an email: [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

This knowledgbase is built using [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) tools and techniques.
