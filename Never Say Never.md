"No Clue" ([30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3msSlr4PkDE&t=1854s)) and especially "Never Say Never" ([7:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3msSlr4PkDE&t=470s)) are flat-out terrific songs. And they're completely original! "Never Say Never" has a kind of melancholy that reminds me of early The Smiths, even without the jangly guitar. The backing vocals, the "ahh, ahh, ahh" is just perfect. These kids came up with that? If so, their musicality is off-the-charts! The band whose members like to do Pony Sweat is no one-trick pony.

Never Say Never, especially, is a fine bit of song creation for any age.

 [@X1xone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnoaPC8GmCMbnb9jiBIWjiw) Indeed. It’s a perfect composition, lacking nothing. It’s not just the melody and the chord progression, but the arrangement. E.g., [9:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3msSlr4PkDE&t=587s) with the wordless vocal line over the repeated 8th notes from the upper register of the guitar. So evocative of The Cure, early R.E.M., The Smiths. None of those bands could’ve done better than this. It boggles the mind.

I agree with everything you've said [ @Mark Farfaglia ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRsJ3Bi6ZVxIAAvJkRFwqYA) . Talk about pop sensibilities, Never Say Never consists of four parts and every single one of them is a hook. I just wish the other girls were providing backing vocals in parts like they do in No Clue. I don't know why there's so much hype over Racist, Sexist Boy because it's not a true representation of their potential the way these two songs are. Now that they're signed, I hope they don't get over produced, the one girl's dad is a producer/engineer at Epitaph, so probably not. Have you heard the studio versions of these songs, they're even tighter?
