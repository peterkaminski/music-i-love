# Level Up

## Notes

This song has a lot of dynamic variation in the arc of its narrative (as it were).  It tries to fit a _lot_ into 3m53s, and mostly succeeds... but it all runs very fast, which I think ultimately limits the overall emotional impact.  (Not that it's an easy trade-off, and where it ended up is not necessarily wrong.)
