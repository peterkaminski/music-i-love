### Ramble On

[[Ramble On]], the amazing [[Led Zeppelin]] song.

Originally, I thought it was a magical song that couldn't be covered well, but then, I discovered there are a bunch of decent and good covers on YouTube.

Today I watched [[Rick Beato]]'s [What Makes This Song Great?â„¢ Ep.87 LED ZEPPELIN (#2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCN97ZS7Ax4) where he breaks down the magic of the Led Zeppelin performance.

But, if I listen to the covers, the song still sounds great, even if the performance is good but not genius.

So, a question: Do the covers sound good because I'm hearing _through_ them back to the original Zeppelin performance?

I think the answer is no, that along with the magic of the Led Zeppelin performance, it's also just a really well-structured song, as long as you do a soulful rendition of it.

I started a YouTube playlist: [Ramble On](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLADGyQqAcmiqSCaGbwcKme0R_1CtYWHAj) (Peter Kaminski) (YouTube playlist).
