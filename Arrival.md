# Arrival

## Notes

From [Abba In The Studio](https://abbamikory.blogs.com/abbamikory/2013/05/interesting-interview-with-michael-b-tretow-in-february-1980.html):

> On one song (Arrival) the Moog was picked up by two ambience mics only. To get a 'natural' sound, as if it were a bunch of real instruments playing out in the studio, I moved the amp in the room for every overdub we made, and recorded each harmony in stereo on two tracks. If you listen to the record it's very hard to tell what instrument it is; it sounds like all-metal bagpipes - or something.
