[The Story Behind the Solo: Pink Floyd’s “Comfortably Numb” \| The Tone Mob](https://tonemob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bg21.png)

> The “Comfortably Numb” solo was recorded with a Strat into Hiwatt amps and Yamaha RA-200 rotating speakers. (5) In interviews, Gilmour says he usually uses a fuzz pedal, delay, and a bright EQ setting while playing near the threshold of feedback to get his signature sustain tones. His gentle use of vibrato from a shortened whammy bar also contributes to his distinctive sound. To compose his solos, he often records himself singing a part and then works it out on the guitar. To generate additional ideas, he will improvise several solos over a recorded chord progression and choose the best parts for the final version. (6) In this way, Gilmour combines a methodical approach to composition with the spontaneity of improvisation.

> “Comfortably Numb” reflects the conflict and collaboration between Gilmour, Waters, and Ezrin. Gilmour created the music as part of a solo album project, but had not yet used it. Ezrin talked Waters, who wanted The Wall to be all his, into writing lyrics for Gilmour’s music. Ezrin orchestrated the first part of the song, which had originally been edgier in Gilmour’s demo. With the orchestral version blended with Gilmour’s harder rock solo, the song took shape as we now know it. (maybe 4)
