> The glide on the Moog part wasn't done by the modern/conventional "mod wheel" -- it was actually a broken fault on the Moog IIIP that George owned. According to their tech, Ed Veale, the fault was that a few keys had lost their sustain and when your released a key, it would (instead of sustaining) glide down to the lowest note on the register. So, while you can certainly recreate this with a pitch wheel, it's not ever going to be as exact as the faulty Moog key fall.
