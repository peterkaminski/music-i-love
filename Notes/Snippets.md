A short piece of a song performance that sounds great.

The bass solo / breakdown in [[Natasha Bedingfield]]'s [[Unwritten]] by [[Pomplamoose]] ft. [[MALINDA]], 02:02 to 02:21: [Unwritten | Natasha Bedingfield | Pomplamoose ft. MALINDA at 02:02](https://youtu.be/OwdL95K6JsU?t=122). The four on the floor drum, the funk bass riff, the vocals, the hand claps -- it all comes together beautifully.

[[Paula Cole]]'s sustained note in [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[In Your Eyes]] (Secret World Live), 01:17 to 01:26: [Peter Gabriel - In Your Eyes (Secret World Live) at 01:17](https://youtu.be/evN6DIGPIJM?t=76). Beautiful, clear tone.

[[Steve Winwood]]'s sax-like pitch-bend synth solo on [[Valerie]], 02:40 to 03:07: [Valerie (Remastered 2010) at 02:40](https://youtu.be/gUNOsiuSJ9w?t=160). (We tend to use wheels nowadays, but I believe the original version was on a [[Multimoog]] with a ribbon and a mod wheel.)
