## Notes

[What was used for the sound in the ascending line right before the chorus?](https://gearspace.com/board/showthread.php?p=15092404) 

(thenoodle) (2020-11-07):

> That's [[Benny Andersson|Benny]] on quadruple overdubbed [[minimoog]] doubled with his 2-part piano line. Which itself was doubled AND, the second overdub is routed through an [[mxr flanger]] (of all things)....and....listen to the neat way the mxr messes with the final chord dieaway of the track.  
 > 
 > Slightly diff filter settings on each square wave overdub pass.  
 > 
> A fine fine single there in 1975. Many have felt it's a perfect pop single. Note how the timing is actually speeding up/slowing down on the choruses. No click track. Eight passes of the background voices. Even dry drums doubletracked. Masses of punch-ins as the group hadn't yet integrated synchronized machines.  
>   
> Everyone I knew in production liked that track. [[Bruce Blackman|Blackman]] did an even more extensive mm overdub approach later that year on his own "[[Moonlight Feels Right]]" with similar minimoog settings.  
>   
> The intro piano line as well as the riffs into the chorus do have classical hints. I've never checked into if Benny mentions those coming from any specific pieces.
